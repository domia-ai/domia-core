# audio-playback

This module is responsible for playing `.wav` audio files generated by the TTS system.

## Purpose

To locally play DOMIA's responses using the system speaker, in a fast and configurable way.

## Responsibilities

- Detect operating system and choose the appropriate player (afplay, aplay, ffplay, etc.).
- Execute playback of `.wav` or `.mp3` files.
- Support fallback in case of no audio output (optional: save to disk or log).
- Allow adjustable volume in the future.

## What it doesn't do

- Does not generate audio (that's handled by `tts-engine`)
- Does not convert text to audio
- Does not decide what to say

## Typical Usage

```ts
await playAudio("output.wav")
```

## Description

The audio-playback module is a crucial component in DOMIA's voice interaction system. It provides a cross-platform solution for audio playback, ensuring that TTS-generated responses are delivered to the user through the system's audio output devices. The module is designed to be lightweight and efficient, focusing solely on the playback functionality while delegating other audio-related tasks to specialized modules.
