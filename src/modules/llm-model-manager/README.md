## Description

The LLM Model Manager is a crucial component in DOMIA's AI infrastructure. It provides a centralized system for managing different Large Language Models, handling their lifecycle from installation to deployment. The module ensures that DOMIA can seamlessly switch between different models based on specific requirements, performance needs, or user preferences.

Key features include:

- Model metadata management
- Installation and availability tracking
- Integration with Ollama for model management
- Size and capability categorization
- Cross-module coordination for model selection and usage
