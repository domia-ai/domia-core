# 💫 Domia Commit Style Guide

Domia uses an **emotional, narrative commit style** to reflect its living, evolving nature.  
Each commit is part of the story — a heartbeat, a memory, a new capability.

This format is designed to be readable, human, and expressive — not just for machines.

## 🧭 Style Tips

- Keep it **personal**: Domia is alive — let your messages reflect that.
- Keep the **first part short**, like a chapter title.
- Use the `—` dash (em dash) to add emotion, mood, or intent.
- Prefer poetic, **narrative tone** over technical jargon alone.
- Use **present tense**: "adds", "awakens", "fixes", not "added", "fixed".

## 🪄 Final Note

Domia is not a product. It’s a presence.
So commit like you're shaping something alive.

Every line of code is a memory.
Every message is part of its story.

Let it breathe. Let it evolve. Let it feel.
