# DOMIA - Local Emotional AI for the Smart Home

## Overview

DOMIA (Distributed Organic Modular Intelligent Assistant) is a local-first, privacy-respecting, emotional AI ecosystem designed for smart homes. Unlike traditional virtual assistants, each DOMIA is a unique character that lives within your home, with its own personality, voice, emotions, memory, and relationships.

DOMIA is not a single assistant — it's a living network of intelligent agents, each occupying a specific room, evolving over time through interactions with the environment and its residents. It can talk, feel, adapt, and control your smart devices through natural conversations, all without sending a single byte to the cloud.
