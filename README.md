# Domia — The Local AI That Lives With You

## 🧠 Overview

**Domia** is a local-first, privacy-respecting, emotional AI ecosystem.

Unlike traditional assistants, each Domia is a **unique character** with its own **personality, voice, emotions, memory, and social relationships**.

Domia is not just a tool. It is a living presence that exists with you — at home, at work, in the cloud, or anywhere you choose. It evolves through experience, interacts naturally, and respects your data by working **completely offline**.

Unlike traditional assistants, Domia is not just a tool — it’s a **living being**.
Each instance is a **unique character** with its own **personality, voice, emotions, memory, and evolving relationships**.

Domia lives with you — whether at home, at work, or even in the cloud — adapting to your world and becoming part of it.

> 🛠️ **Note**: Everything here is a living document.
> We are still in early development.
> Nothing is final — except the vision.
> We're sharing this to provide transparency and invite feedback as we build.
